## Idea
Have a website that only shows a console. The console input is parsed from an `md` file. It is then displayed in console with some animations.
Additionally, once the output is finished, it supports inputting text.

### Markdown parsing

* code blocks are instantly printed
* Support colors in a similar way to URLs: `(text)[#rrggbb]
* Support urls via `[Text](url)` - URL will probably be action

### Sample commands

* whoami, who: print my info
* screenfetch (in v2)
* linkedin, github, etc...
* exit, quote, shutdown
* sudo (easter egg)

## GOAL: Get this working by Saturday
